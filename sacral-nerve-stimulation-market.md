<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sacral Nerve Stimulation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Implantable SNS</li><li>External SNS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The sacral nerve stimulation (SNS) market comprises two primary types: implantable SNS and external SNS. Implantable SNS involves surgically placing a device that stimulates sacral nerves to manage conditions like urinary incontinence and overactive bladder. This method offers long-term relief and effectiveness. In contrast, external SNS utilizes non-invasive devices to provide similar stimulation without surgery, making it more accessible and less risky. Both types aim to enhance patient quality of life while addressing specific urological and pelvic health issues.</p></p>
