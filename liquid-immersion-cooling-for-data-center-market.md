<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Liquid Immersion Cooling for Data Center Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Phase Cooling</li><li>Two Phase Cooling</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Liquid immersion cooling for data centers involves submerging servers in thermally conductive liquids to efficiently manage heat. In the single-phase cooling market, the coolant remains in a liquid state, absorbing heat and transferring it away without phase change. In contrast, two-phase cooling employs a liquid that vaporizes upon heat absorption, allowing the vapor to rise and condense, creating a continuous cooling cycle. Both methods enhance thermal management, increase energy efficiency, and reduce the environmental impact of data centers.</p></p>
