<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heavy Truck Engine Brake Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Compression Release Brake</li><li>Exhaust Brake</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The heavy truck engine brake market primarily consists of two main types: compression release brakes and exhaust brakes. Compression release brakes function by releasing compressed air from the engine cylinders, creating a powerful deceleration force. In contrast, exhaust brakes work by restricting the exhaust flow, increasing back pressure and reducing engine speed. Both systems enhance vehicle control and safety during downhill travel, contributing to improved braking performance and reduced wear on traditional braking components, making them essential for heavy-duty trucking applications.</p></p>
